* ``subsystem``: string

    Subsystem to monitor events from. Optional.

* ``devtype``: string

    Only report events with this device type. Optional.

* ``tag``: string

    Only report events with this tag. Optional.

===============
A table with ``what`` entry:

  option was set to ``true``);

* if it is ``"timeout"``, the function has not been called for the number of seconds specified as
  the ``timeout`` option;

  additional entries (all are optional strings):

  - ``syspath``;

  - ``sysnum``;

  - ``devpath``;
