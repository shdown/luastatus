Overview
========
This derived plugin checks whether a certain program is running, although
in order to this plugin to work, the program should indicate its state
via one of the following widespread mechanisms:

  1. PID file;
  2. Creation of a file. The file must have a fixed path;
  3. Creation of a file (with any name) in an otherwise-empty directory. The directory
     must have a fixed path.

Functions
=========
The following functions are provided:

* ``make_watcher(kind, path)``

  Returns a watcher; a watcher is a function that takes no argument and returns a single
  boolean value indicating whether the program is running.

  Kind must be either ``"pidfile"``, ``"file_exists"``, ``"dir_nonempty"`` or ``"dir_nonempty_with_hidden"``:
    * ``"pidfile"`` means check by PID file located at path ``path``;
    * ``"file_exists"`` means check by existence of a file or directory at path ``path``;
    * ``"dir_nonempty"`` means check by whether a directory located at path ``path`` is non-empty (**excluding** hidden files);
    * ``"dir_nonempty_with_hidden"`` means check by whether a directory located at path ``path`` is non-empty (**including** hidden files).

* ``widget(tbl)``

  Constructs a ``widget`` table required by luastatus. ``tbl`` is a table with the following
  fields:

    **(required)**

    - ``cb``: a function

        The callback function that will be called with current CPU usage rate, or with ``nil``.

    **(exactly one of the following is required)**

    - ``kind`` and ``path``: strings

        Please refer to the documentation for the ``make_watcher`` function above for
        semantics of ``kind`` and ``path``.
        If ``kind`` and ``path`` are specified, the plugin will only monitor state of a
        single program, and ``cb`` will be called with a boolean argument.

    - ``many``: array

        If specified, the plugin will monitor states of N programs, where N is the length
        of the ``many`` array. The array should contain tables (each being a watcher
        specification) with the following entries:

          * ``id``: string

            A string used to identify this entry in the ``many`` array;

          * ``kind`` and ``path``: strings

            Please refer to the documentation for the ``make_watcher`` function above for
            semantics of ``kind`` and ``path``.

        If ``many`` is specified, ``cb`` will be called with a table argument in which
        keys are identification strings (``id`` entry in the watcher specification;
        see above), and values are booleans indicating whether the corresponding
        process is running.

    **(optional)**

    - ``timer_opts``

        Options to pass to the underlying ``timer`` plugin. Note that this includes the period
        with which this plugin will check if the program(s) is running.
        The period of the ``timer`` plugin defaults to 1 second.

    - ``event``

        The ``event`` entry of the resulting table (see ``luastatus`` documentation for the
        description of ``widget.event`` field).
