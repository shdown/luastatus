Overview
========
This derived plugin periodically polls Linux ``sysfs`` for the current
readings of various temperature sensors.

Functions
=========
The following functions are provided:

* ``get_temps(data)``

  Returns either an array or nil.
  If the result is nil, no data is currently available (most likely reason for this is
  that the set of temperature sensors has changed; if so, the subsequent calls will
  return non-nil).

  Each array entry corresponds to a subsequent temperature sensor; it is a table with the following fields:

  * ``kind`` (string): kind of this temperature sensor; either ``"thermal"`` (``/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone*``
    sensors) or ``"hwmon"`` (``/sys/class/hwmon/*`` sensors).
  * ``name`` (string): name of this temperature sensor; it is either:
    - for ``"thermal"`` kind: ``"thermal_zone${i}"``, where ``${i}`` is the index of the thermal zone, or;
    - for ``"hwmon"`` kind: the contents of ``/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon${i}/name`` file, where ``${i}`` is the index of hwmon sensor.
  * ``path`` (string): full path to the sensor readings file.
  * ``value`` (number): current temperature, in Celsius degrees.

  The array is sorted first by kind (``"thermal"`` entries go first), then by sensor index (``${i}`` above).

  In order to use this function, you are expected to maintain a table ``data``, initially empty,
  and pass it to ``get_temps`` each time.
  The only things the caller is allowed to do with this table (either before the first call or after a call) is:

    - set ``please_reload`` field to ``true``; if ``please_reload`` field is true when
      this function is called, the function will forcefully reload all information and reset
      ``please_reload`` field to ``nil``.

    - set ``filter_func`` field to a function that takes two string arguments (kind and name), and returns
      a boolean indicating whether this sensor should be monitored. If not set, all sensors will be monitored.

* ``widget(tbl[, data])``

  Constructs a ``widget`` table required by luastatus.

  If ``data`` is specified, it must be an empty table; you can set ``please_reload`` field
  in this table to force a full reload. On each reported event, before a call to ``tbl.cb``,
  this field is reset to ``nil``.

  It is technically possible to set ``filter_func`` field of the ``data`` table to a filter function (see above),
  but it is recommended to set it via ``tbl.filter_func`` field (instead of ``data.filter_func``).

  ``tbl`` is a table with the following fields:

  **(required)**

  - ``cb``: a function

    The callback function that will be called with current readings of temperature sensors, or with ``nil``.
    The arument is the same as the return value of ``get_temps`` (see above for description
    of ``get_temps`` function for more information).

  **(optional)**

  - ``filter_func``: function

    This must be a function that takes two string arguments (kind and name; see the description of the
    ``get_temps`` function above for what they mean), and returns a boolean indicating whether this sensor
    should be monitored. If not specified, all sensors will be monitored.

  - ``timer_opts``: table

    Options for the underlying ``timer`` plugin.

  - ``event``

    The ``event`` entry of the resulting table (see ``luastatus`` documentation for the
    description of ``widget.event`` field).
