Overview
========
This derived plugin periodically polls Linux ``sysfs`` for the state of a battery.

It is also able to estimate the time remaining to full charge/discharge and
the current battery consumption rate.

Functions
=========
The following functions are provided:

* ``widget(tbl)``

    Constructs a ``widget`` table required by luastatus. ``tbl`` is a table with the following
    fields:

    **(required)**

    - ``cb``: function

        The callback that will be called with a table with the following keys:

        + ``status``: string

            A string with battery status text, e.g. ``"Full"``, ``"Unknown"``, ``"Charging"``,
            ``"Discharging"``.

            Not present if the status cannot be read (for example, when the battery is missing).

        + ``capacity``: number

            A percentage representing battery capacity.

            Not present if the capacity cannot be read.

        + ``rem_time``: number

            Time (in hours) remaining to full charge/discharge.

            Usually only present on battery charge/discharge.

        + ``consumption``: number

            The current battery consumption/charge rate in watts.

            Usually only present on battery charge/discharge.

    **(optional)**

    - ``dev``: string

        Device directory name under ``/sys/class/power_supply``; default is ``"BAT0"``.

    - ``period``: number

        The period in seconds for polling ``sysfs``; default is 2 seconds.

        Because this plugin utilizes ``udev`` under the hood, it is able to respond to
        battery state changes (such as cable (un-)plugging) immediately, irrespective of
        the value of the period.

    - ``event``

        The ``event`` entry of the resulting table (see ``luastatus`` documentation for the
        description of ``widget.event`` field).
