Overview
========
This plugin monitors current keyboard layout, and, optionally, the state of LED indicators (such as
"Caps Lock" and "Num Lock").

Options
=======
The following options are supported:

* ``display``: string

  Display to connect to. Default is to use ``DISPLAY`` environment variable.

* ``device_id``: number

  Keyboard device ID (as shown by ``xinput(1)``). Default is ``XkbUseCoreKbd``.

* ``led``: boolean

  Also report (and subscribe to changes of) the state of LED indicators, such as "Caps Lock" and
  "Num Lock".

* ``how``: string

  This option controls which method of obtaining the list of group names is used.
  Currently, there are two methods.

  The first one, codenamed "*wrongly*", is the default one; it consists of
  querying and parsing the ``_XKB_RULES_NAMES`` property of the root window.
  This method is known to be wrong, and on current Debian Sid it does not work as expected:
  on a setup with two keyboard layouts, English and Russian, it reports only the English one.
  Specify ``how="wrongly"`` to use this method.

  The second one, codenamed "*somehow*", consists of calling
  ``XkbGetNames(..., XkbSymbolsNameMask, ...)`` in order to obtain a string called "symbols",
  which looks like this::

      pc+us+ru(winkeys):2+inet(evdev)+group(rctrl_toggle)+level3(ralt_switch)+capslock(ctrl_modifier)+typ

  Note that this string has been truncated to exactly 99 characters (the end should have been
  ``typo`` and then probably something else).
  It was not me who truncated it, but rather the guts of X11. And I have no idea why.
  The fact that this string can be truncated certainly does not contribute to the reliability of
  this method.
  We obtain the list of group names, then, by splitting the "symbols" by plus signs, and then
  filtering out known "bad" symbols (that do not indicate a keyboard layout).
  This is quite unreliable, but somehow works.
  Specify ``how="somehow"`` to use this method.

* ``somehow_bad``: string

  Comma-separated list of bad symbols for the "somehow" method (note that normally it should
  not include spaces). Set to empty string to express an empty list.
  The default value is ``group,inet,pc``.

``cb`` argument
===============
A table with the following entries:

* ``name``: string

  Group name (if number of group names reported is sufficient).

* ``id``: number

  Group ID (0, 1, 2, or 3).

* ``requery``: boolean

  True if either this is the first call, or this call is due to a change in keyboard geometry, the
  *list* of layouts, or similar event that requires re-query of the list of group names.
  Otherwise, ``requery`` is nil. This is useful for widgets that fetch the list of group names via
  some external mechanism (e.g. by parsing the output of a command): they need to re-query the
  list if ``requery`` is true.

* ``led_state``: number

  Bit mask representing the current state of LED indicators.

  On virtually all setups,
  bit ``(1 << 0) = 1`` is "Caps Lock",
  bit ``(1 << 1) = 2`` is "Num Lock",
  bit ``(1 << 2) = 4`` is "Scroll Lock".

  To list all indicators your X server knows of, run ``xset q``.
  If you look at the output, you will note there are a lot of weird things that are, in some
  reason, also considered indicators; for example, "Group 2" (that is, alternative keyboard
  layout) corresponds to ``(1 << 12) = 4096`` on my setup. So you should not assume that, just
  because your physical keyboard has no indicators for other things (or no indicators at all),
  the mask will never contain anything other than "Caps Lock", "Num Lock" and "Scroll Lock".

  Note that bitwise operations were only introduced in Lua 5.3.
  The "lowest common denominator" (working on all Lua versions) check if a bit is set is
  the following::

      function is_set(mask, bit)
          return mask % (2 * bit) >= bit
      end

  Use it as follows::

      cb = function(t)
          -- ...do something...

          if is_set(t.led_state, 1) then
              -- "Caps Lock" is ON
              -- ...do something...
          end

          if is_set(t.led_state, 2) then
              -- "Num Lock" is ON
              -- ...do something...
          end

          if is_set(t.led_state, 4) then
              -- "Scroll Lock" is ON
              -- ...do something...
          end

          -- ...do something...
      end,
